# YT8-H
A YouTube bookmarklet, It puts a movable youtube iframe on any page.
It uses yout-ube so there are no ads.
It also hides the iframe when the mouse is off of the iframe.
Please note: This will not work on age restricted videos(like all embeds), It also won't work one some sites(Prob becuase of stricter cors policies)
<iframe
  src="/demos/index.html"
  style="width:100%; height:300px;"
></iframe>
## You can get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YT8-H/YT8-H/main/YT8-H.js). (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Add it as a bookmark, name it whatever you want).
