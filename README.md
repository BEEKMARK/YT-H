# YT8-H
## It puts a movable youtube embed/iframe on any page.
It uses yout-ube so there are no ads, It also hides the iframe when the mouse is off of the iframe.
Please note: This will not work on age restricted videos(like all embeds), It also won't work one some sites(Prob becuase of stricter cors policies)

## It works with a ton of other sites too!
Put another site url into the prmpot and it will make a iframe of that site!

## You can get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YT8-H/YT8-H/main/YT8-H.js). (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C, Add it as a bookmark, name it whatever you want).
